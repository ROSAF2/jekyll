## *Referencing*

#### **In-text referencing** 

* Citing an Idea 

> **Basic:**  
   `Paraphrase + (Surname, year)`  
   *E.g., While groups and organisations can provide members with support and security, they can also sometimes be controlling and coercive (Sullivan, 2001).*  


> **Author name in sentence:**  
   `Surname (year) + paraphrase`   
   *E.g., Sullivan (2001) points out that while groups and organisations can provide members with support and security, they can also sometimes be controlling and coercive.* 


* Citing a quote 

> **Basic:**  
   `" …" + (Surname, year, p.(page number))`  
   *E.g., “Periods of quiet and of active sleep (often called REM sleep because of the rapid eye movements) alternate throughout the night, with a total of perhaps ninety minutes devoted to REM” (Gleitman, 1995, p.6).*

> **Author name in sentence:**  
   `Surname (year) + "..." (p.(page number))`

## *Book Summary*

#### **Chapter 7: Technical Proposals**

**Suggestions To Convince The Reader** 

1. `Present Only Essential Information`

   Divide the information into two: 

   * Information the reader MUST have to make a decision (Need-to-Know information) 

   * General interest information the reader does not need to make a decision (Nice-to-Know details) 

2. `Use the Active Voice` 

   Active voice makes you sound firm, confident and knowledgeable. 

   Example: 

   * Passive: "The two computers would be connected by means of a metal wire and a fibreoptic cable, whereas alternating from one cable to the other would be accomplished by a Model 1880 switching unit." 

   * Active: A wire and fibreoptic cable will connect the two computers, while a Model 1880 switching unit will alternate between them. 

3. `Avoid Wishy-Washy Words`

   Replace would, could, and should with will. The former words create a soft impression whereas the latter creates a much more confident impression. 

   Avoid low-information-content expressions, e.g.: 

   * "Bring to a conclusion" change for "concludes" 
   * "In the direction of" change for "toward" 
   * "by means of" change for just "by" 

   Instead of vague statements use descriptive words whenever possible, e.g.: 

   * "Adequate supply" for "three-week supply" 
   * "Got some help" for "two technicians helped us" 
   * "Many tests will be attempted" for "we will carry out thirty tests"  

4. `Avoid Giving Opinions` 

   Withhold your opinions until the end of the proposal and maintain your objectivity until you make your recommendation.
