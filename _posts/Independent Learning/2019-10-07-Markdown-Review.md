```C#
//This is just one line of code
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
```

This is a table

| Name | Age  |
| :---: | :--- |
| John |  20  |
| Jane |  19  |  

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| `git status`   | git status     | git status    |
| `git diff`     | git diff       | git diff      |

__This text is bold__  
*and this one is italic*  
__*and this one has both*__

Now here is an unordered list:
- item A
- item B
- item C

And this is an ordered list:
1. lol
1. lool
1. loool

This list combines both

- item A
    1. lol
    1. lal
        - item B
        - item C
            - item D
                1. No
                1. Yes

### Now, here is another way we can use links *(refernece links)*
